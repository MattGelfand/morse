							<p class="primary-graph contain">This project focused more on storytelling than UX, as the audience ended being an auditorium of professors, parents and students as opposed to a specific demographic or user-base. Students were teamed in groups of three and tasked with constructing an interactive one-page site based on a topic of their choosing. Our team chose the craft beer industry - fitting given Chicago's burgeoning scene - and picked five brewers at different stages of their careers to illustrate how the culture has changed over the years.</p>

							<h1 class="section-heading centered">Brewing Up a Narrative Structure</h1>
							<div class="underline centered">━</div>
							<p class='primary-graph'>In order to illustrate each brewer's story, we needed to first understand the basic elements of a narrative structure, which acted as an outline for how we gathered information during the reporting process. For instance, a typical narrative structure includes a conflict, rising action, climax, resolution and falling action. At first, the team considered applying this concept to the craft beer industry as a whole, but that had already become a tired narrative (mass-market brews in the 80s and early 90s giving way to more creative and complex options around the early 2000s). Instead, we focused that structure on five midwestern brewers, such as Milwaukee's Lakefront Brewery, which is teetering on the brink of mass market expansion and fears selling out, or startup Pollyanna Brewery in Lamont, IL, which is just now attempting to break into the thoroughly saturated craft beer scene.</p>
							<p class="primary-graph">
							Each team member contributed on the reporting side, while I coded the site using Bootstrap as a base, and customizing from there.

							<h1 class="section-heading centered">Final Product</h1>
							<div class="underline centered">━</div>
							<p class="primary-graph">We broke out story up into five "chapters", introducing each brewer with a quick opening blurb near the top of the page, followed by a devoted section for each brewer that users could click to as they scrolled down the page.</p>

							<p class="primary-graph" id="update"><em>*Update:</em> The domain for the class site containing the projects has expired. I'm currently working to get the story up on my own server.
